            This recipe is a fine blend of many earthly elements mixed with a splash of early 1900s heavy grade alchemy found only in the Full Metal Alchemist Cinematic Universe put together to create a human.
            Humans are creatures found in fascinating spots such as "sidewalks", "grocery stores", and "houses". They have many fascinating uses though the main ones being industrialization, and existential crises.
            Lastly, and most importantly, they are <ins><strong>NOT</strong></ins> edible.<em> Side effects include lost limbs, people in the vicinity disappearing, and possible death (at least according to the anime)</em>
            <p><sub>do not try this recipe under any circumstances, highly unadvisable</sub></p>
