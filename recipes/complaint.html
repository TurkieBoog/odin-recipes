        <p>When you disagree with somebody on the internet for one reason or another, what used to happen in the ancient days was you either left them alone or call their mother obese. Those primitive years are behind us now, ushering in a new dawn of Russian bots, racial slurs, people doxxing each other, and the invention of new ways to tell others to "kick rocks" as the kids say.</p>
